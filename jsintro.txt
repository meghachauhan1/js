JavaScript

Browser run javascript (Frontend technology)
1. We can change any thing in the html page.
2. We can call an API to get data from database.
3. Cannot connect to database directly (we need to use API for getting data).
4. You don't have access to computer low level resources (e.g. Disk, CPU, RAM).


Server run javascript (Nodejs, backend technology)
1. You can read and write files directly to the disk.
2. You can also have general control of CPU and RAM.
3. You can directly connect to database and get the data. (You can use API here also).
